            <p className="leading-relaxed">
            Like many others, we once sat with stacks of books, chasing the UPSC dream. We spent years immersed in polity, history, and ethics‚Äîshaping ourselves for a future in governance.<br/><br/>
            But somewhere in the middle of all those long study sessions, something unexpected happened.<br/><br/>
            We realized that while we respected the path, we weren‚Äôt truly in love with it. What really set our minds on fire was something else entirely‚Äîtechnology, problem-solving, and building things that could create impact beyond just ourselves.<br/><br/>
            The decision to step away from the UPSC grind wasn‚Äôt easy. It felt like leaving behind a battle we had trained for. But once we made that choice, we knew it was the right one. With technology, we could solve real problems in real time. We could build, experiment, and create something that wasn‚Äôt just a theoretical answer on paper, but a real solution that could change the way aspirants learn and improve.<br/><br/>
            That‚Äôs how MARS was born. We knew the struggles of aspirants firsthand‚Äîthe frustration of vague feedback, the guesswork of improvement, the sheer loneliness of self-study. And we wanted to fix it with something that felt like a mentor, not just a tool.<br/><br/>
            MARS is more than just an answer evaluation system. It‚Äôs our way of bringing tech into a space that desperately needs innovation. It‚Äôs proof that sometimes, the right path isn‚Äôt the one you first set out on‚Äîbut the one that truly makes you come alive.</p>

            <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground mb-8">
              Every serious UPSC aspirant knows this: writing great answers is half the battle. You spend hours structuring responses, 
              trying to balance clarity, depth, and precision‚Äîonly to wonder:
            </p>
            <div className="pl-6 mb-8 border-l-4 border-primary/20">
              <p className="text-lg mb-2">‚ùì Is my answer actually good?</p>
              <p className="text-lg mb-2">‚ùì Am I writing like a topper, or just filling pages?</p>
              <p className="text-lg">‚ùì Would an evaluator reward this or tear it apart?</p>
            </div>
            <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground mb-4">
              Coaching institutes give vague feedback. Peer reviews are inconsistent. Self-evaluation? That's a shot in the dark.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground">
              That's why we built MARS (Mains Answer Review System)‚Äîan AI-powered evaluator designed for UPSC aspirants who want real, 
              structured feedback on their answers.
